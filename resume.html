      <h3>First Semester (Fall, Year 1)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start building your resume right away—include relevant coursework, class projects, and past internships/work experience.</li>
        <li>Visit the Career Development Office (CDO) early for a resume review. It’s much easier to polish from the start than to fix everything later.</li>
        <li>Join student orgs or volunteer opportunities and start tracking your contributions—you’ll want those bullets on your resume.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Second Semester (Winter, Year 1)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Update your resume with new projects, research, or internships secured during the academic year.</li>
        <li>Tailor your resume toward summer internship applications—highlight technical, research, or UX skills relevant to your field.</li>
        <li>Attend a Resume Refresh workshop or a peer review session to get feedback from multiple perspectives.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Summer (Between Year 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add your internship experience as soon as it starts—don’t wait until the end.</li>
        <li>Capture impact by tracking metrics, tools used, and outcomes. These details are fresh now but easy to forget later.</li>
        <li>If you don’t have an internship, focus on projects, research assistantships, or independent work that show practical application of skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Final Year (Fall &amp; Winter, Year 2)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Refine your resume for full-time job applications—tailor each version to match the job description.</li>
        <li>Make sure your bullets emphasize outcomes (numbers, efficiency gained, impact made), not just tasks.</li>
        <li>Keep it concise: one page is ideal for most Master’s students.</li>
        <li>Schedule a final review with a CDO career coach before submitting applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pro Tip: Treat your resume as a living document—update it every semester, after every major project, and after every new role.</p>
